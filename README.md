# De-Morgans-Laws-within-the-context-of-fuzzy-set-theory-in-MATLAB
This MATLAB script demonstrates De Morgan's Laws within the context of fuzzy set theory. The script generates three random fuzzy sets and verifies De Morgan's First and Second Laws by computing the complements of unions and intersections of these sets. It also visualizes the original sets and the results using plots.
